People for years have been saying to me, when are you going to do something psychological? Like, I can't stomach the violence. When is there something that I can see? And this is that movie. I wanted to make a film that was like fatal attraction for the millennials. I wanted to have a real actor's piece, a real stylish camera work, real fantastic sex scene, but also go dark and twisted and crazy in a way that nobody else can, but without using the violence. I want psychological violence. I'm substituting destruction of art for destruction of body parts.

Evan Weber, we had a type of guy that we wrote, and it was our producer, Miguel Asensio, said, this has to be Keanu Reeves.
